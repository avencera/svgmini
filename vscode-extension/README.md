## What?

A tool to minify SVGs that are contained in other documents (for example HTML or JSX files).

## Why?

Lots of tools and plugins exist to minify SVGs for example:

- [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo)
- [svgcleaner](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/svgcleaner)
- [SVG VSCode Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jock.svg)

However none of them did what I wanted, which was to minify SVGs within my HTML files.
